# Machine Learning Mutation-Acyclicity of Quivers   
This repository contains code scripts for data generation and machine learning of quiver mutation classes. The workflow is split into 4 experiments, the first 3 use neural networks to classify between mutation classes directly, and then between supersets of mutation classes expressing mutation-acyclicity or not. The final experiment uses support vector machines, outputting a directly interpretable equation format (here PCA methods are also used to confirm the data representation compression).
